# JavaScript Calculator

A responsive, browser-based calculator built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

This project was created as part of a guided tutorial to strengthen my understanding of core JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and class-based architecture. Throughout the build, I debugged issues independently and now fully understand how the logic and flow of a functional calculator works.
